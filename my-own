You have a data file. You don't know what is the delimiter so that you can import the data and print it out on the screen.
Given that the delimiter is an uncommon one, how do you find out what the delimiter is?

--> one way is to count frequency of each character that appears in the file. Then print out multiple possibilities of the data
set and *visually* choose the most appropriate looking one. The user's choice will then let the program know what the delimiter is.
